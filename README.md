## README

In this repository, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and multiple linear regression (MLR) are exercised by analyzing and modelling the King County House Sales 
dataset (available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). The dataset contains sales data for properties in King County, Seattle, Washington, US including prices and property characteristics such as diverse footage measures, geo information, etc. 

The EDA is not exhaustive but oriented at a house buyer's stakeholder point of view and addresses particular questions and interests arising when buying a house.

In the MLR part, I try to predict the house prices in King County using only simple and multiple linear regression models.
